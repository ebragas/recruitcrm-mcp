## Recruit CRM API Reference

- **Base URL:** `https://api.recruitcrm.io/v1`
- **Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer <RECRUIT_CRM_API_KEY>`

### Key Endpoints

| Endpoint | Docs |
|---|---|
| `GET /candidates` | [Search candidates](https://docs.recruitcrm.io/docs/rcrm-api-reference/253721386feef-search-for-candidates) |
| `GET /candidates/{slug}` | [Find by slug](https://docs.recruitcrm.io/docs/rcrm-api-reference/6de2e46e80e6a-find-candidate-by-slug) |
| `GET /jobs` | Jobs list |
| `GET /jobs/{slug}` | Job by slug |

### Field Mapping Gotchas

- Candidate company → `current_organization` (not `company_name`)
- Candidate job title → `position` (primary populated field)
- Candidate resume → object: `{"filename": "...", "file_link": "..."}`
- Job status → `job_status` object: `{"id": 1, "label": "Open"}`
- Job description → `job_description_text` (HTML)
- Pagination: candidates min 100/page, jobs min 15/page — `per_page` below minimums is ignored

## Conventions

### Git Branching

- Branch from `main`
- Branch naming: `<issue-id>/<short-description>` (e.g., `MAIN-73/scaffold-mcp`)
- Linear auto-tracks branches with issue IDs in the name

### Code Style

- Source layout: `src/recruit_crm_mcp/`
- Keep tools focused — one tool per logical API operation
- API key via `RECRUIT_CRM_API_KEY` environment variable

### Workflow

1. Create branch with issue ID (e.g., `MAIN-73/scaffold-mcp`) — from `main` or parent feature branch
2. Transition the Linear issue to "In Progress"
3. Comment on the Linear issue that work is starting
4. Implement, run `make check` to verify
5. Check off completed subtasks on the Linear issue description
6. Use `/commit-commands:commit-push-pr` to commit, push, and open a PR
7. Transition the Linear issue to "In Review"

### Linear Integration

- Agent ID: `claude-code-recruitcrm-mcp`
- **Linear project:** `Build Recruit CRM MCP` — always include `--project "Build Recruit CRM MCP"` when creating issues
- Comment on issues when starting and completing work
- Transition issues through: Todo → In Progress → In Review → Done
- Valid states: Backlog, Todo, In Progress, In Review, Done, Canceled, Duplicate
